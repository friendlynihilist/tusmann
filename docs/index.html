Hoffmann narra le singolari avventure dei tre pretendenti alla mano di una giovane e affascinante fanciulla. Uno solo di loro avrà la mano della ragazza, ma gli altri due riceveranno, in cambio della rinuncia, dei doni per loro ancor più preziosi. In particolare il cancelliere Tusmann, curiosa figura di attempato bibliofilo che difficilmente avrebbe potuto rendere davvero felice la giovane, riceve un dono che non potrebbe lasciarlo più soddisfatto: un libro magico, dalle pagine bianche ma capace di trasformarsi all’istante in qualunque altro libro al semplice desiderio del suo proprietario. Il libro magico del cancelliere Tusmann è una sorta di libro universale, e le sue pagine bianche possono riempirsi, a comando, con i testi più diversi: il sogno di ogni bibliofilo. Anche lo schermo di un computer può riempirsi con i testi più diversi. In un certo senso, il computer assomiglia molto al libro magico del cancelliere Tusmann. </p><p><em>Roncaglia, Gino. (2010).

Many intellectuals like the philosopher Erasmus highly esteemed Manutius for his tireless efforts in restoring ancient learning. In addition to their textual value, many Aldine editions embody Aldus restless efforts to re-configure the printed book both as a typographical and commercial product, marking him as an innovative publisher of his age. His enchiridia, small portable books, revolutionized personal reading and are the predecessor of the modern paperback. </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="manuzio-logo.b5bd4d0b.png" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Printer's mark</h1> <p> The symbol of the dolphin and anchor has been used since Roman times to illustrate the adage <em>Festina Lente</em>. This emblem appeared for the first time as Manutius' mark in 1502, and in contrast to the tradition before Aldus, it was located in the first pages of the book instead of the ending pages. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="manuzio-margins.62b97195.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Margins</h1> <p> In ancient paginated books, margin measures were chosen accordingly to the reconstructed Van de Graaf's canon and resulted specularly symmetrical. This "secret canon" allowed for the construction of a pleasingly divided page with proportions 2:3:4:6 (inner:top:outer:bottom). I checked proportions from several Aldine Editions images on the web and found the correct ratio between margins, images and font size. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="manuzio-typeface.bda12109.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Typeface</h1> <p> Manutius commissioned the punchcutter Francesco Griffo of Bologna to create a new typeface designed to look like the handwriting of humanists both in Latin and Greek, since at the time printed works only imitated formal manuscript hands (either blackletter or the humanistic littera antica). Manutius and Griffo's original typeface is the first known model of italic type. I chose a font ("Griffo Classico") that had the most similar characteristics: letters appear in high contrast with serif. For frontispiece and image captions I used a small capital font ("Griffo Classico Small Caps"). </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="manuzio-initials.aec4d0f6.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Initials</h1> <p> I decided to imitate the elegant initials with branch, tendril and grapevine decorations (known as bianchi girari – white vine stem decoration) with a delicate and simple font called "Roycroft". </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="manuzio-images.8176bb77.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Images</h1> <p> It turned out to be impossible to reproduce the extraordinary skill of the craftsmen who engraved the sophisticated illustrations of many Aldine editions, expression of the “classical” style generally regarded as typical of the best Venetian illustrations of the late 1490s.

OD&D was published by TSR in 1974 as a digest-sized boxed set in a wood-grain box. The set included three books. <br> In 1983, the Basic Set was revised again by Frank Mentzer, and redubbed Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules. The 1983 revision was packaged in a distinctive red box, and featured cover art by Larry Elmore. Between 1983 and 1985, the system was revised and expanded by Mentzer as a series of five boxed sets, known with the acronym of BECMI. <br> Dungeons and Colons is a love song for this sometimes goofy yet iconic piece of visual design, capable of provoking an immediate sense of nostalgia and marking the imagination of millions of players. </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="ded-die.63d614e2.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Die</h1> <p> There is no Dungeons and Dragons without dice. By throwing a die, the player and the Dungeon Master determine all the events in the game world, from casting a spell to the impact of a speech to incite peasants against the local evil (and usually fat) baron. I recreated the legendary 20-sided dice (d20) through CSS and JS, and programmed a series of scripts to offer the reader a little taste of the game system. <br> <em>(thanks to Matthew Lein for the original project)</em> </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="ded-typeface.0dd78570.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Typeface</h1> <p> The front cover of BECMI uses a custom tweak of Quentin TF for the Dungeons and Dragons text, while other title page text is done in Korinna. The text itself is set in 9 point body type with 10 point leading. This is a very tight set. The interior text for BECMI books is almost entirely different weights of Baskerville. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="ded-margins.7049ad89.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Margins and page size</h1> <p> The BECMI series of books is particularly interesting for its reliance on a three-column layout and an extremely expansive header. The text is justified and very dense, with a short baseline grid. Perhaps the most immediately striking characteristic of the BECMI rulebooks is the enormous and incomprehensible top margin, while the usual canons of page design insist on a large bottom margin to give the page a sound footing for putting the thumbs while reading. I’ve recreated the margin and applied one format of the running head with two thick lines. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="ded-tables.c944e25b.jpg" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Table Design </h1> <p> A notable characteristic of the so-called old-school D&D is its horrible table design. BECMI tables make heavy use of very thick, dark strokes at head and foot, usually with a lighter stroke after the table’s title. This stroke pattern is repeated in multiple places, even on text elements that aren’t actually tables. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlock"> <img src="ded-illustration.6f324a91.png" alt="" class="popup__img"> <div class="popup__text"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Illustrations </h1> <p> One other habit of the designers was to break through the running head with black and white illustrations that almost invariably fit exactly into the column layout. This design choice that has become classic will be taken up by all the major role-playing publishers in the following years, e.g. the beautiful illustrations by Gary Chalk for Lone Wolf. I’ve introduced similar illustrations at section end as separators and before the footer, using :before and :after pseudo-elements. I’ve also tried to recreate the high contrast chalk-esque feeling of illustration for photos using filters. </p> </div> </div> <div class="styleDescriptionBlockNoImage"> <div class="popup__text textNoImage"> <h1 class="popupHeading">Bibliography and sitography</h1> <ul> <li>Gygax, G. & Arneson, D.
